# Reddit Story to Short Video Generator

### 🚀 Project Motivation

Social media has taken over as a primary form of entertainment, with platforms like TikTok, YouTube Shorts, and Instagram Reels offering quick, engaging content that captures millions of views. A popular trend involves creators narrating dramatic Reddit stories (like r/AmItheAsshole posts) over entertaining visuals such as Minecraft parkour. These videos have proven to be a goldmine, generating significant revenue for content creators🤑.

As a CS student, I thought:
“Why spend hours creating these videos manually when I can automate the process? MORE MONEY, FASTER. MUHEHEHE!”

This project was born from that thought—a tool to transform Reddit stories into short-form videos ready to dominate TikTok, YouTube Shorts, Instagram Reels, or any other vertical video platform. It combines automation, storytelling, and content creation to save time and help creators scale their efforts.

2.	Generating Narration: Converts the story text into AI-generated narrator audio.
3.	Creating Videos: Combines narration with a Minecraft parkour or other background video and adds captions.
4.	Providing Downloads: Allows users to download the completed, ready-to-post video.

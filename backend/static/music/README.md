# Background Music

Place your background music files here in the following formats:
- `.mp3`
- `.wav` 
- `.m4a`

## Recommended Music Types:
- Lo-fi instrumental music
- Calm ambient music
- Light background music (not too intense)

## Music Volume:
The app automatically sets background music to 30% volume to ensure the narration is clearly audible.

## Example Files:
You can download royalty-free music from:
- YouTube Audio Library
- Freesound.org
- Zapsplat (with account)
- Pixabay Music

## Note:
If no music files are found in this folder, videos will be generated without background music.
